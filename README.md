## Overview

This project implements the Sparse Bayesian Learning algorithm using MATLAB, based on the hierarchical Bayesian model described in Tippingâ€™s paper.
<br>
It focuses on learning sparse solutions for linear regression problems.

## Features

- Implementation of the **RVM (Relevance Vector Machine)** formulation
- Hierarchical Bayesian modeling with **automatic relevance determination**
- Comparison with standard algorithms (e.g., OLS, Ridge)
- Supports **noise estimation**, **sparse posterior inference**
